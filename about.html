            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Death Row Records is an American record label founded in 1991 by The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, Suge Knight,
                and Dick Griffey. The label became a sensation by releasing multi-platinum hip-hop albums by West
                Coast artists like Dr. Dre (The Chronic), Snoop Dogg (Doggystyle), and 2Pac (All Eyez on Me) in
                the 1990s. At its peak, Death Row was making over **$150 million** annually.
                <br><br>
                By the late 1990s, the label began to decline due to the loss of its star artist, 2Pac, the imprisonment
                of Suge Knight, and the departures of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Although financially successful, Death Row
                was plagued by controversies, lawsuits, and violence.
                <br><br>
                The label filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and was auctioned to WIDEawake Entertainment for **$18 million**
                in 2009.
                It later changed ownership multiple times, with Snoop Dogg acquiring it in February 2022, aiming to
                revive
                its legacy.
